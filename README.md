## Simple Install:
- `npm i`
- Rename the "env" to .env.
- Fill out the .env file. ([Get a Free Database - Not Sponsored](https://mongodb.com/))
- `npm start`
- Now invite the bot using the invite in the .env file. **Note: Change the "APPLICATION_ID" in the link to your Bot ID!**
- Your bot should now be ready to go!

## ⚠️ Please note: This is far from stable

I won't recommend using this bot until the first release marked as stable is out.
